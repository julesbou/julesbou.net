Frameworks are great. They help you build secure and easily-maintainable applications fast. They provide you tools to do things sometimes you don't want to do by yourself, like authentication, forms, ORM, etc. 

As a good programmer you want more and more control and you can't let other third-party libs manage your code. You want to keep an eye on your code and keep the technical level up to maintain your application. 

An ideal framework should give you the flexibility to either reuse existing modules and classes or create them from scratch. So some day you might come up with a question like,

_Frameworks do all the work for authentication mechanisms, but if one day you work on a project from scratch will you be able to create the authentication mechanism yourself ?_

I've created a project called `SimpleFramework`, it's a framework, nothing more. `SimpleFramework` wants to be as small as possible with minimal features: templating, routing, controller, .. SimpleFramework doesn't want to do all the work for you, you are the real conductor of your project!

__I will be very happy to hear your feedback or bugs you may encounter__
